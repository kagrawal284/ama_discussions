### Question10 : Explain SOLID in brief.

- SOLID is an acronym that represents five design principles for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable object-oriented code.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or purpose. 
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. 
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program. 
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. 
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.


### Question11: Difference between instance and static variable

- The static variable belongs to the class rather than any individual instance. The instance variable belongs to an individual instance of a class.
- Static variable is initialized only once at the start of the execution. Instance variable is initialized each time an instance of the class is created.
- If changed, the new value is available to all instances of the class in case of static variable. 	Changes to the variable affect only the instance in which the change was made in case of instance variable.
