### Question1: What is csrf token and csrf attack?

Solution: CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Token is a security measure used to protect web applications from CSRF attacks. It is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value generated by the server-side application and sent to the client (usually embedded in the HTML of a web form or in a hidden input field). The client must send this token back to the server with any state-changing requests (such as form submissions, account updates, etc.). The server then validates the token to ensure that the request is genuine and not forged.

**CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Attack** is a type of malicious exploit of a website where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts. Essentially, it tricks the user into performing actions that they did not intend to do, without their knowledge.


### Question2: What are validators in Django?

Solution: They are used to ensure that the data conforms to certain criteria.

Django comes with several built-in validators that can be used out-of-the-box.

- MaxValueValidator
- MinValueValidator

You can define your own validators if the built-in ones do not meet your requirements.

```bash
from django.db import models
from django.core.validators import MaxValueValidator, MinValueValidator

class MyModel(models.Model):
    age = models.IntegerField(validators=[MinValueValidator(0), MaxValueValidator(100)])
    email = models.EmailField(validators=[EmailValidator(message="Enter a valid email address")])

```

### Question3:  Difference between authorisation and authentication ?

Solution: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do.


### Question4: What are the common types of web attacks?

Solution: 

- CSRF attack:  An attacker tricks a user into performing actions on a different website where they are authenticated.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): An attacker injects malicious scripts into content from otherwise trusted websites. These scripts are then executed in the context of a user's browser.


### Question5: What is session cookie and token ?

Solution: Session cookies are used to store information about a user's session on a web server. They are temporary and typically last only for the duration of the user's session on the website. Once the user closes their browser, the session cookie is usually deleted.

Tokens are pieces of data used to authenticate and authorize users in web applications.


### Question6: What are some of the common security vulnerabilities in web applications 

Solution: Web applications can be vulnerable to various security threats. Here are some of the most common security vulnerabilities:

- CSRF attack:  An attacker tricks a user into performing actions on a different website where they are authenticated.
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): An attacker injects malicious scripts into content from otherwise trusted websites. These scripts are then executed in the context of a user's browser.


### Question7: what is session hijacking?

Solution: Session hijacking, also known as session fixation or session theft, is a type of attack where an attacker takes over a valid user session. This can allow the attacker to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to the web application.

### Question8: what is difference between encryption and decryption?

Solution:
- Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (readable data) into ciphertext (unreadable or scrambled data) using an encryption algorithm and an encryption key. The primary goal of encryption is to protect data from unauthorized access by making it unintelligible to anyone who does not possess the correct decryption key.
- Decryption is the process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext using a decryption algorithm and a decryption key. The goal of decryption is to reverse the encryption process, making the original data readable again.


### Question9: What are the common security mistakes developers make when using Django, and how can they be avoided?

Solution: 
- Mistake: Using the default SECRET_KEY in production.
    - Solution: Always generate a unique, strong SECRET_KEY for each Django project. Keep it secret and avoid hardcoding it into the codebase. Use environment variables or Django's django-environ package to manage secret keys and other sensitive settings.
- Mistake: Not serving the application over HTTPS.
    - Solution: Always use HTTPS in production to encrypt data in transit. 
- Mistake: Allowing users to set weak passwords.
    - Solution: Enforce strong password policies using Django's AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS settings. 
- Mistake: Disabling Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection or not using it correctly.
    - Solution:Ensure that CSRF protection is enabled and correctly implemented. Use Django's built-in CSRF protection middleware and decorators.


### Question10 : How do we check password similarity? Is there a validator?

Solution: Yes, Django provides a built-in validator to check for password similarity. You can use the UserAttributeSimilarityValidator which is part of Django's authentication system. This validator checks if the password is too similar to the userâ€™s attributes, such as username, email, or any other specified fiel
