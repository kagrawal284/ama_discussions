### Question1 : What is difference between synchronous and asynchronous in js?

Solution: In JavaScript, synchronous and asynchronous refer to the way in which code is executed and how it handles tasks like I/O operations (such as reading files or making network requests).
- In synchronous code, statements are executed line by line, and each statement has to wait for the previous one to finish executing. Synchronous code can be easier to read and reason about, but it can lead to performance issues and blocking behavior, especially in web applications where responsiveness is crucial.
-  In asynchronous code, statements don't necessarily execute sequentially. Instead, operations that take time (like fetching data from a server or reading a file) are initiated, but the program doesn't wait for them to complete. Instead, it continues executing the next lines of code. When the asynchronous operation finishes, a callback function is executed to handle the result. Asynchronous code allows for non-blocking behavior, which is essential for responsive applications, particularly in web development.
  
### Question2 : What is difference between .py and .pyc files?

Solution: 
- .py files are the source code files written by developers
- .pyc files are compiled bytecode files generated by Python to improve the performance of importing modules and executing Python code.
  
### Question3 : What is the purpose of the if _name_ == "_main_": statement in Python scripts? 

Solution : The if __name__ == "__main__": statement in Python scripts serves as a conditional block that allows you to execute certain code only when the script is run directly, as opposed to being imported as a module into another script. If the script is imported as a module into another script, Python sets __name__ to the name of the module.

### Question4 : What is generator function in python?

Solution: A generator function in Python is a special type of function that allows you to generate a sequence of values lazily, on-the-fly, rather than computing and storing all values at once. This can be particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences, as it can save memory and improve performance.

- Generator functions use the yield keyword to produce a series of values one at a time, pausing execution between each value. 
- One key advantage of using generator functions is that they don't compute all values at once and store them in memory, but rather generate values on-the-fly, which can be more memory-efficient, especially for large datasets or infinite sequences.
  
### Question5 : Differentiate javascript and node.js

Solution: 
- JavaScript is a programming language primarily used for client-side web development. Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side, enabling server-side scripting to build web applications.

### Question6 : What are mutable and immutable method in js?

Solution:
- Mutable methods are those that changes the original array, object. Immutable methods are thode that do not change the object.
- Some mutable methods of objects are: Object.defineProperty(), Object.assign(), whereas immutable methods include Object.entries(), Object.keys()
- Some mutable methods of arrays are Array.push(), array.pop(), whereas immutable methods include map(), filter(), concat()
  
### Question7: What is a zip function?

Solution: A "zip" function is a common operation in programming languages, which combines multiple lists into a single list of tuples, where each tuple contains the corresponding elements from each of the input lists.The resulting list has a length equal to the shortest input list.

### Question8 : How to know the type of any variable in python?

Solution: In Python, you can determine the type of any variable using the type() function. 

### Question9 : What is Object.entries()?

Solution: In JavaScript, Object.entries() is a method that returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs.

### Question10: What happens if you call some variable(defined using the let keyword) in a function before defining it?

Solution : Accessing the variable before its declaration will result in a ReferenceError. However, accessing the variable after declaration but before it's assigned a value will yield undefined.

### Question11: What is an event listener in JS?

Solution: In JavaScript, an event listener is a mechanism to handle events that occur in a web page. Events can be user actions like mouse clicks, key presses, or system-generated events like page loading, resizing, etc. Event listeners "listen" for these events and execute a callback function when the event occurs.

Here's a breakdown of how event listeners work:

- Event Registration: You select an HTML element(s) on which you want to listen for events. This can be done using methods like getElementById, querySelector, or by accessing elements directly.

- Event Binding: You attach an event listener to the selected element(s) using methods like addEventListener. This method takes the event type (such as 'click', 'mouseover', 'keydown', etc.) and a callback function as arguments.

- Event Handling: When the specified event occurs on the selected element(s), the callback function associated with the event listener is executed. This function can perform any action you define, like modifying the DOM, fetching data from a server, or updating variables.
